# Introduction to Flipside Mod Manager

Flipside Mod Manager is a mod manager for Super Paper Mario, allowing you to easily edit a game rom for texture mods and rel mods without needing to use riivolution. FMM doesn't provide any game files on its own, it requires a game rom to dump files for them to be editable.

## Required Software

### Wiims ISO tools

Wiims ISO tools (aka WIT) is required for this program to run properly, as it allows it to extract and recompile the game files. You can get a release for your system from [here](https://wit.wiimm.de)

### Code editing
For editing the code you'll need to install [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org) and then install [DevKitPro](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) so that you can compile the rel files needed to modify game code

### Other tools

To replace music and textures you'll want to download [Brawlcrate](https://github.com/soopercool101/BrawlCrate), which allows you to edit files which you can put back in your mod project. I recommend using notepad ++ for editing the dialogue as the null bytes throw off other text editors and end up making it a garbled mess.
